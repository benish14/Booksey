# Booksey
BooksKey is a simple and interactive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to manage a collection of books efficiently. Users can add new books by entering the title and author, and the added books are displayed in a list. Each book entry can also be removed from the list easily.
